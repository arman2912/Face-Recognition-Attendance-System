## Face Recognition Attendance System

The interface brings into play an easy and a secure way of taking down attendance by
face recognition. The software first captures an image of all the authorized persons and
stores the information into database. The system then stores the image by mapping the
various facial landmarks of the original face structure. Next time whenever the
registered person enters the premises the interface recognizes the person and marks his
attendance along with the time.
